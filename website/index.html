            <p>This is my first ever html and css website, I look forward to maintaining it and making it perfect over time. 
                This project is 3 pages long and i aim to show and flex my ability to make websites as a beginner. <br>
                I have taken part in creating a board game, that teaches youngster’s the Arabic language at a basic level, 
                and sold over 300 copies. This took a team of two, around 8 months of work to come up with the game from scratch, 
                including marketing the product, making rules and information guide, manufacture it overseas, packaging it correctly 
                and creating advertisements. This experience has taught me many key skills with the challenges I faced, having to 
                communicate with people in different parts of the world, and being dedicated to the goal & making the game successful, 
                also in this experience I was used excel to log in data from this project, as well as analysing it to see where we can 
                improve, and then using the data and feedback to start planning the making of the next game.
